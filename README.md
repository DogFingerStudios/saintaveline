## 🎮 Game Backstory

**Saint Aveline** is a tense survival experience set in the world of [Yanorra](https://github.com/DogFingerStudios/Yanorra). On the island of Saint Aveline—once a quiet refuge off Duvessa’s coast—war has arrived. As the mainland burns in civil conflict between the authoritarian **Dornish Order** and the insurgent **Sombra-Qhari Guerrillas**, the island’s fragile peace collapses overnight.

Players take the role of a father struggling to escape the siege with his wife, children, and elderly father. Trapped amid the occupation, the family must navigate shattered streets, scarce resources, and impossible moral choices. Every decision carries weight—each mistake could cost a life.

## 🎯 **Prototype Goals**

- ✅ Establish basic player movement (FPS + 3rd person toggle).
   - 🔹 <s>First Person</s>
   - 🔹 Third Person
   - 🔹 1st/3rd Person Toggle
- ✅ <s>Build a small portion of the tower (Ground Floor + 9th Floor + Roof).</s>
- ✅ Implement basic AI
   - 🔹 Patrol
   - 🔹 Chase
   - 🔹 Attack
- ✅ Create initial stealth and combat mechanics.
- ✅ Set up family NPCs with basic interaction and survival dynamics:
  - 🔹 Friendly NPCs (e.g., SonNPC) use a custom C# state machine
  - 🔹 States for POC: **Idle** (rotates to face player) and **Follow** (tracks player via NavMeshAgent)
- ✅ Establish basic ending conditions (reach the roof or kill all guards).

     - 🛡️ **Ground Floor** – Sandbags, entry points, 1–2 guards
     - 🏠 **9th Floor** – Player apartment, family interaction
     - 🚁 **Roof** – Flare signal point
   - Use ProBuilder or modular building assets

3. **Lighting and Atmosphere**
   - Use dim lighting for tension

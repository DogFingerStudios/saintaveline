        // and the enemy NPC has fetched all references. This test runs before all that.
        // The next problem, is that we need to use [UnityTest] to do that. Which means...
        // We need to use Assembly Definitions! Now this can be a pain, but if we do it, we need to
        // do it now before the project grown too large.
        // Within the Assembly Definition this script is under, we will need to add reference to the
        // UnityEngine.TestRunner and UnityEditor.TestRunner assemblies.

        // See folder "_UnitTests" and "UnitTestExample.cs" for an example of the Assembly Definition setup.
